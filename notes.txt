System Installs:
----------------
We install neovim, vimplug, rofi, kitty, zsh, ohmyzsh, and 
zsh-syntaxhighlighting/zsh-autosuggestions to setup our terminal.

File manager:
-------------
Thunar. Download lxappearance and you can customize gtk3 apps from there
Copy nvim.desktop to /usr/share/applications to get Thunar to open files with neovim.

System Theme:
-------------
Used the Catppuccin theme. Their GitHub repo has a lot of style guides and 
theming for a lot of apps.

** There is more specific guides in some of the directories **
