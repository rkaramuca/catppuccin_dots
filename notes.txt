System Installs:
----------------
We install nvim, vimplug, zsh, ohmyzsh, and 
zsh-syntaxhighlighting/zsh-autosuggestions to setup our terminal.

File manager:
-------------
Nautilus. Download lxappearance and you can customize gtk3 apps from there

Download udisks2 and ntfs-3g
udisksctl mount -b /dev/<driveName>
udisksctl unmount -b /dev/<driveName>
OR
mountext

Polybar:
--------
Kept it simple. Used adobe-source-han-sans-jp-fonts for the Japanese font and
waffle (located in .fonts) for the glyphs.

System Theme:
-------------
Used the Catppuccin theme. Their GitHub repo has a lot of style guides and 
theming for a lot of apps.

** There is more specific guides in some of the directories **
